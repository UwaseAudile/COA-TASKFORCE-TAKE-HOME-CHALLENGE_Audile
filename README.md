COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge

This repository demonstrates my solution for the COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge. The challenge involved developing an interactive photo gallery and tackling two coding problems using JavaScript.

To access the project directory, enter cd interactive-photo-gallery in your command line interface. Next, open the index.html file in your web browser to view the interactive photo gallery. You can also examine the index.js file to understand the gallery's underlying structure and functionality.

CSS Styling
I have employed CSS for styling the gallery features, ensuring a pixel-perfect match with the Figma designs. Additionally, I have used media queries to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices. This approach guarantees that the interactive photo gallery maintains its functionality regardless of the user's device or viewport size.

Coding Challenges
For the coding challenges, navigate to the Challenges directory using the command cd Challenges in your terminal. Once there, open the arrayMap.js and stringTransform.js files in your preferred code editor to review the solutions.

Array Manipulation Challenge (arrayMap.js)
I devised a function to determine the presence of a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to a target value. The solution adheres closely to the given problem statement and constraints, ensuring the expected time and space complexities are met.

String Transformation Challenge (stringTransform.js)
I crafted a function to modify a string based on the specified rules. The solution efficiently handles all potential scenarios outlined in the problem statement while achieving the expected time and space complexity requirements.
